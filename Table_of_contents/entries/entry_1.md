# Entry 1 : Intro/Plan
<p> 
For this project we have been given a choice to decided from a list
on what we want to work on. I have decided to work EarSketch, because I 
really enjoy music and I have never created my own music before. In this
project I hope to create a song or several songs from one of my favorite genres
in musc, DUBSTEP. I hope to create music that everyone can enjoy and will like
to listen too every day. Music is a great way to bring people together and 
with the power of technology and the music I create, I hope to bring people
closer together.
