# Entry 1 : Intro/Plan

For this project we have been given a choice to decided from a [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sYGyd4bthxhJ7Ap5X89Dc9YWKubw8T9lOAzvt0OIwuY/edit)
on what we want to work on. I have decided to work EarSketch, because I 
really enjoy music and I have never created my own music before. In this
project I hope to create a song or several songs from one of my favorite genres
in musc, DUBSTEP. I hope to create music that everyone can enjoy and will like
to listen too every day. Music is a great way to bring people together and 
with the power of technology and the music I create, I hope to bring people
closer together.

# What is EarSketch?

[EarSketch](http://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/) is a website that allows
users to create their own playlist of music using Python or JavaScript. Not
only does EarSketch allow you to make your own music, but it also teaches users
how to code with no prior experience. The best part about EarSketch is that it
is completely free to use and anyone can express themselves through the power
of music. EarSketch provides its own online tutorial on how to use the app.
