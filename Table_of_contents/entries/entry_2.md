# Old Roots
    
It has been a while, since I have seen or even used JS. I had to relearn
everything, because I forgot what the syntax looks like. I am glad the syntax
does not look too ugly from what I remembered(Joke inteded). Reviewing the 
syntax and basic of JS was not difficult, because I have done before. Once 
I saw how the syntax worked I began to remember more and more, after every 
lesson. It just instantly clicked in my mind and I remembered how JS is supposed
to look like. 
    
# Thoughts

I have remembered most of the syntax of JS, but not all. I need to continue
my self-education on code academy. Most of my review for the past week as been
on the basic syntax of JS. I remember how set most of the conditionals, however
I still need more practice, because there has been couple of examples on code 
academy that has given me some trouble. My goal for the end of this week is to 
remember how to use and set up conditionals and create a little method that does
something using conditionals.
    
# Review of JS


When re-learning JS, I found it very helpful to take notes on everything I was
learning. Taking notes made me pay more attention to details, and to the syntax.
Taking notes just made me remember so much more that I thought that I had forgotten.
Here is a link to the learning that I have done this week with JS, as I continue
my education I plan to update my notes with the newest information that I learn.

# Take aways

One important take away that I realized was that taking notes is not just for school.
Taking notes on anything you want to learn, whether in school or on your own is
benefical because that's your interpretation of the information. Taking notes demonstrates
your understanding of the topic and can help you remember much easier in the future
if you ever need it. For this reason I am re-learning JS before heading into the studio
booth. I want to be able to plan using psudo-code and then test out in repl to discover
any bugs. One this note when using markdown, if you indent before typing it creates 
a white box around the text, where everything inside will be converted to a string.
